    <h1>Assignment 1: Blink!</h1>
    <p>
      For this assignment, I built a blinking light pattern using an Arduino and
      three LEDs. The main goal was to make each LED blink independently using
      separate digital pins and a simple timing pattern.
    </p>

    <h2>Schematic and resistor calculations</h2>
    <img src="schematic_calc.png" width="470" />
    <p>
      This diagram shows how the circuit is wired: each LED is connected in series
      with its own resistor and then to a digital output pin. I calculated resistor
      values using a 5V source and each LED’s forward voltage. The resistor limits
      current to keep both the LEDs and the Arduino pins safe.
    </p>

    <h2>Circuit on breadboard</h2>
    <img src="blinkpic2.png" width="470" />
    <p>
      I used two red LEDs with one white LED in the middle to make the pattern
      easier to see. Each LED is wired in series with its own resistor and connected
      to Arduino digital pins 12, 11, and 10. All LED cathodes connect to the ground
      rail, which connects back to Arduino GND. Since each LED has its own pin and
      resistor, each one can blink without affecting the others.
    </p>

    <h2>Arduino Code</h2>
    <pre><code>
      // Declare digital pin for first red LED
      const int Mypin12 = 12;
      
      // Declare digital pin for white LED
      const int Mypin11 = 11;
      
      // Declare digital pin for second red LED
      const int Mypin10 = 10;
      
      void setup() {
        // Configure pin 12 as an output
        pinMode(Mypin12, OUTPUT);
      
        // Configure pin 11 as an output
        pinMode(Mypin11, OUTPUT);
      
        // Configure pin 10 as an output
        pinMode(Mypin10, OUTPUT);
      }
      
      void loop() {
      
        // Blink the first red LED three times quickly
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
          // Turn the first red LED on
          digitalWrite(Mypin12, HIGH);
          // Keep the LED on briefly
          delay(150);
          // Turn the first red LED off
          digitalWrite(Mypin12, LOW);
          // Pause before the next blink
          delay(150);
        }
      
        // Blink the white LED two times
        for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
          // Turn the white LED on
          digitalWrite(Mypin11, HIGH);
          // Keep the LED on briefly
          delay(150);
          // Turn the white LED off
          digitalWrite(Mypin11, LOW);
          // Pause before the next blink
          delay(150);
        }
      
        // Blink the second red LED three times
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
          // Turn the second red LED on
          digitalWrite(Mypin10, HIGH);
          // Keep the LED on briefly
          delay(150);
          // Turn the second red LED off
          digitalWrite(Mypin10, LOW);
          // Pause before the next blink
          delay(150);
        }
      
        // Pause before restarting the full blinking pattern
        delay(1000);
      }
      
    </code></pre>

    <h2>Circuit Operation</h2>
    <img src="blink.gif"  width="450"/>
    <p>
      This GIF shows the final blinking sequence. The first red LED blink three times,
      and the white LED blinks two times in the middle, then the second red LED blink 
      three times again soon. The pattern repeats with a short pause at the end.

    <h2>Additional Questions</h2>

    <h3>1. Time vs voltage graph</h3>
    <img src="voltage_chart.png" width="470" />
    <p>
      This chart shows the voltage across each LED over time. When a pin is set to
      HIGH, the LED voltage rises to roughly its forward voltage, about 2.0V for
      red LEDs and about 2.5V for the white LED. 
    </p>

    <h3>2. How many LEDs can blink independently and how much current?</h3>
    <p>
      On an Arduino Uno, about 12 pins can comfortably control LEDs independently. 
      12 LEDs would draw about 80 mA total if they were all on at the same time.
    </p>

    <h3>3. How fast until blinking looks continuous?</h3>
    <p>
      Blinking starts to look continuous around 20 ms, so the LED appears steady
      instead of flashing.
    </p>

    <h3>4. AI Tool Usage</h3>
    <p>
      I used AI tools to help clarify circuit concepts, like asking question regarding to 
      my voltage chart to understand if it is posisble to have 0 voltage drop.
      I also received help from AI tool to organize my code for a1.html web page and 
      make overall style.css formatted in a way that provides better readibility for viewers.
